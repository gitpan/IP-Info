    | Key     | Required | Description                            |
    +---------+----------+----------------------------------------+
    | api_key |   Yes    | API Key given by Quova.                |
    | secret  |   Yes    | Allocated share secret given by Quova. |
    +---------+----------+----------------------------------------+

    use strict; use warnings;
    use IP::Info;

    my $api_key = 'Your_API_Key';
    my $secret  = 'Your_shared_secret';
    my $info    = IP::Info->new({ api_key => $api_key, secret => $secret });

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ip_address()

If  an  IP  address  is specified in the correct format, then the call returns an
object of type L<IP::Info::Response> object which can be queried further to  look
for specific information for that IP. In case it encounters any error it'll throw
an exception.

=item * dot-decimal e.g. 4.2.2.2

=item * decimal notation e.g. 67240450

    open(SCHEMA, ">$file") or die ("ERROR: Couldn't open file [$file] for writing: [$!]");
    print SCHEMA $response->{content};
    close(SCHEMA);
